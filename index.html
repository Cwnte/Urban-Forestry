    <h1>URBAN FORESTRY</h1>
    
    <div class="container">
        <div class="main-content">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Urban Forestry is a concept that blends art, science, and modern technology combining urban diversity and forestry in a city to benefit residents with the psychological, sociological, aesthetic, economic, and environmental benefits trees bring to society.</p>
            <p>Urban Forestry has an impact on issues such as erosion control, noise and air pollution abatement, wastewater management, watershed conservation, and glare, reflection, and traffic control are all addressed in part by urban forestry.</p>
            
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The trees in an urban area, including those in yards, along streets and utility corridors, in protected areas, and watersheds, are collectively referred to as an urban forest. Urban forests are frequently the most extensive, useful, and noticeable type of urban green infrastructure. The natural and semi-natural urban infrastructure known as "green infrastructure" offers ecosystem services including storm water management and air pollution reduction.</p>
            
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>It aims to improve air, water, and land resources, create wildlife habitats, manage erosion, safeguard watersheds for urban water supply, and serve as a safe dumping site for urban garbage. It would also boost urban residents on their psychological, sociological, aesthetic, and economic demands.</p>

        <div class="sidebar">
            <h2>Budget</h2>
            <p>The anticipated expenses range from 800 PHP to 3,500 PHP, depending on the type of trees planted. Other costs might include planting materials. The overall expenditures would range between 3 and 5 million PHP, depending on the environment in which the trees would be planted.</p>
